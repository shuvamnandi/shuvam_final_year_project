The decline of Moore's law has led to a fundamental shift in the design of micro-processor architectures. Devices performance initially used 
\textbf{Yet to be completed...}
With advancements in technology, parallel processing architectures such as multi-core processors, digital signal processors (DSPs), graphics processing units (GPUs), massively parallel processor arrays (MPPAs) and field programmable gate array (FPGA) based accelerators are gaining popularity for accelerated execution of compute kernels.
